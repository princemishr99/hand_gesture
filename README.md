In this project I basically focus on producing a model which can recognize Fingerspelling based hand gestures in order to form a complete word by combining each gesture. Sign language is one of the oldest and most natural forms of communication. However, since most people do not know sign language and interpreters are very difficult to come by, we have developed a real-time method using neural networks for fingerspelling-based sign language. This innovative approach aims to bridge the communication gap, making it easier for sign language users to interact with those who are unfamiliar with the language. Our system leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to recognize and translate hand gestures into text, providing an accessible and efficient solution for inclusive communication. This new technology not only enhances accessibility but also promotes inclusivity, ensuring that everyone can engage in meaningful conversations regardless of their language abilities. The future of communication is here, and it is more inclusive than ever before.
